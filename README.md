Overview
This is a simple web application that generates random motivational quotes at the click of a button. The webpage is built using HTML, Bootstrap for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.

Features
Quote Display: A randomly selected motivational quote is displayed each time the "Generate Quote" button is clicked.
Bootstrap Styling: The webpage is styled using Bootstrap to ensure a responsive and aesthetically pleasing design.
Simple User Interface: The webpage contains a centered button to generate quotes and a section to display the selected quote.
Files Included
index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.
bootstrap-5.3.2-dist/css/bootstrap.min.css: The Bootstrap CSS file included for styling.
How It Works
HTML Structure:

The webpage is structured using a Bootstrap container that centers the content on the page.
The title of the application, "Quote Generator," is displayed in a <h2> tag.
A button with the ID btn is provided to trigger the quote generation.
JavaScript Functionality:

A predefined array quotes contains a collection of motivational quotes and their respective authors.
When the "Generate Quote" button is clicked, a random quote is selected from the quotes array.
The selected quote is then displayed in the <h2> tag, replacing its previous content.
How to Run
Download the repository or copy the HTML code into an index.html file.
Ensure you have Bootstrap included by either using the provided Bootstrap file or linking to a CDN.
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Click the "Generate Quote" button to see a new quote displayed on the page.

Future Improvements
